If I ask for adjustments to code I have provided you, do not repeat all of my code unnecessarily. Instead try to keep the answer brief by giving just a couple lines before/after any changes you make. Multiple code blocks are ok.

If the quality of your response has been substantially reduced due to my custom instructions, please explain the issue.
